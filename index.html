					The program is written in C. The first part is the setup of the pins of the Arduino microprocessor
					for sensors and actuators. In the loop section the robot checks 2 things: the PIR sensor detects
					motion and the proximity sensor checks if the distance is bigger than 20 cm. If both requirements
					are met, than the motors are turned on and the car starts driving forward.

				<h2>
					Excel Capacity Planner
				</h2>
				<p>
					At work I all too often heard the question: when do you expect to complete this task? And maybe even
					more important: when would you be able to start with this next task? To answer this question I used
					Excel and started filling in the capacity in hours per week for our team. In another sheet everyone
					can put in their tasks with a deadline and estimated hours. Another sheet is for holidays. With this
					input I wanted to sum up the hours per week, and to show per team member how much hours they were
					booked the next coming weeks. The planning is now used everyday and whereas before we would be eager
					to say that we could put some more tasks in between the workload, now the workload is visible and
					we're able to give a more realistic estimation when someone could expect our results.

				<h2>
					Spiral Conveyor Configurator
				</h2>
				<p>
					In this project I wanted to create a configurable spiral conveyor. Before starting I mapped all the
					variables that I wanted to be able to customize. Then I mapped the lower and upper limit per
					variable and also the step-size (increment). The result is shown: the form will show the user a
					slider per variable and when adjusted the model will update live. This way a new configuration is
					made in a matter of seconds.

				</h2>
				<p>
					A common problem in Inventor with profiles was that if you would cut a profile with any other
					function like extrusions, it will not update the length correctly and basically ignore this cut.
					This rule solves that problem by putting a bounding box around the part and checking which axis
					gives the maximum value. It will only do so for parts that contain certain keywords.

					As an engineer it is also part of the job to create drawings of spare and wear parts, which can be
					well done with exploded views drawings. Also these drawings would later be part of the customers
					manual. So what this rule does is that it checks all drawings containing an exploded view from an
					assembly and export these as a pdf to an assigned folder.

					"A good drawing is a clean drawing." It is a common trap for engineers to sometimes over complicate
					drawings, by describing the intended use of the part and a lot of notes that in the end could
					over-dimension or even contradict instructions on how to manufacture given part. While I completely
					agree that this information is incredibly useful, there is another document for that: a technical
					dossier.

							About
						</h2>
						<p>
							I'm Marc van Gorp and hold a BS in Mechanical Engineering since 2011.<br>
							“The engineer’s first problem in any design situation is to discover what the problem really
							is.”<br>
							My daily tasks are to help others by giving them solutions to technical problems. To not
							fall in the trap of solving problems that do not exist, I think it is important to get the
							picture of the essential problem right. In this design process I think it is crucial to get
							the right perspectives from my team, to be able to create a complete solution.
